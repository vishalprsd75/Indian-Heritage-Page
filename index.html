    <span>Among all the Indian heritage, architectural sites are the treat to the eyes of travelers from all over the world. Besides, Indians’ love for its rich history keeps these heritage sites alive. It is the duty of the older generations to invoke the same love and respect for these sites. They shall learn the significance and keep their willingness to preserve the heritage for future generations.<br>
    </span><span>Indian history is as rich as its culture. If we look at the architectural marvels of the heritage sites such as Hampi, Khajuraho, Taj Mahal, Lal Kila, Qutub Minar, Fatehpur Sikri, Bhulbhulaiya, these still hold immense significance in terms of their marvelous art, engineering, construction, and labor behind each site. There are many ancient and historical monuments that stand alive. Some of them took literally one decade to hundred years to be built properly. Such beautiful heritage sites are very rarely seen these days if we talk about modern-day architecture.<br>
        Hence, as responsible citizens, it is our duty to take care of these Indian heritage sites and monuments so that these could be preserved and witnessed by our future generations as well.</span>
